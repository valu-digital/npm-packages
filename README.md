# npm packages

Monorepo of open source npm packages by Valu Digital.

## Community Users‚ùóÔ∏è

Although these are open source we are not resourced enough to properly support
"community users" ‚Äì those not working for Valu Digital. You are free to use
these packages and even open issues here, but it is very likely that we don't
have the time and resources to act on them. Same goes for PRs. Feel free to hard
fork the packages.

## Publishing

The repo contains a Github Workflow which makes it very easy to create and
update the packages. It just requires `build` and `test` package.json scripts.
Do not use prepublish scripts. The workflow will run the build before
publishing. There's no need for additional initialization steps for new
packages: Just create new package directory under `packages/` and you are ready
to go.

**üëÜ Use the`@valu/` namespace for all new packages.**

When a package is ready for publishing just run the `release.sh` from the
package directory.

```
cd packages/example
../../release.sh
```

The script will generate a changelog entry and pushes the code to a version
branch from where the workflow picks it up. The workflow will tag the version,
build the package and publishes it.

The packages are released to the public npm registry.

The release notifications can be found our internal `#npm-packages` channel.

### Prereleases

A prerelease without real version number, changelog and tagging can be made with
the `prerelease.sh` script.

```
cd packages/example
../../prerelease.sh
```

## Hard Forking with History

How to hard fork single package with history
